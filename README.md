Proposal #1: VR Interactive Classroom

One interesting way to incorporate VR would be to make online classrooms more interactive - VR could be used to place the user within the classroom itself, with a professor writing notes on a blackboard at the front. The user would also be able to take virtual notes (using a stylus similar to the paint game we saw demo'd in class) and access those notes in some recorded format after they've exited the VR game.

Proposal #2: VR Choose-Your-Own-Adventure

This would be a virtual reality version of "choose-your-own-adventure" novels. The user would be essentially following characters through different storylines, choosing which character to follow and which major action to take at every turn. The story arcs and endings encountered by the user would be completely different depending on the decisions they chose to make.

Proposal #3: Sports Console in VR

Something else that would be cool to implement in VR would be some sort of sports console similar to Wii Sports. The platform would provide users with a few different sports experiences, such as tennis and boxing, and simulate actual equipment with a stylus (like we saw in the drawing game) and actual events (such as a ball bouncing off a racquet or being punched in the face by a boxer). One thing that would be challenging would be to allow players to "move" to the places necessary to play the games (for example, running across the court), but maybe we could do something where one stylus controls arm movements (such as using a racquet, golf club, etc.) and the other controls high-level movement across the court/playing field/etc.
